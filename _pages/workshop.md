## Mondo Clinical Reclassification Workshop Part 2

### Description
This workshop is a follow-up to the Mondo Clinical Reclassification Workshop (April 2021).
Mondo was reclassified to create a clinical-centric view (see description [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5273598#.YVtjEWZKj0o)), however, many clinically useful terms are still difficult to find as they are subClasses of general grouping terms such as “disease of anatomical system”.
In this workshop, we will propose an updated top-level classification of Mondo which more closely resembles the clinical view of diseases. We will gather stakeholders and community members for their comments, requests, and input.

### Date and Time
**November 17th, 2021**  
12-2pm PST / 3-5pm EST / 8-10pm UK / 9pm-11pm Europe

## Renal Disease and Phenotype Workshop

### Description

This workshop was hosted by Nicole Vasilevsky (Mondo) and Peter Robinson (Human Phenotype Ontology), and brought together experts in kidney disease clinical care. We discussed improvements to classification of the ['kidney disease' (MONDO:0005240)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMONDO_0005240) hierarchy in Mondo. As an outcome of this meeting, the kidney disease hiearchy will be revised in accordance to the classifications described in [Brenner and Rector's The Kidney](https://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/brenner-and-rectors-the-kidney-2-volume-set-9780323532655.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwlrqHBhByEiwAnLmYUCC5SqtlaMQWFvf1qvAu9GbhO3c9VntzXng-TAYftZBPTcu4S5PdVBoC4bUQAvD_BwE) textbook.

## ClinGen Virtual Retreat 2021

### Presentation Title
Mondo Disease Ontology (How ClinGen curators work with the Mondo Disease Ontology, which aims to harmonize disease definitions across the world)

### Presenter
Nicole Vasilevsky

### Description

[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) hosted a virtual retreat for all ClinGen contributors June 24-25, 2021. The retreat provided the ClinGen community and collaborators with an event to learn about and share new and existing work, as well as best practices across ClinGen. This presentation discussed the Mondo Disease Ontology, which is used for gene-disease annotations by ClinGen curators. The **retreat agenda** is available [here](https://clinicalgenome.org/about/events/clingen-retreat-2021/agenda/).

### Date and Time
**June 24, 2021**  
3:40 - 5:10pm Eastern

## Mondo Clinical Reclassification Workshop

### Description: 
A workshop with invited members of the community to work on the top-level classification of Mondo. The workshop focused on semantic modeling of disease and defining ontology patterns. There is a great need for expert clinicians to define clinically relevant navigational grouping classes. These top down and bottom up approaches need to meet in the middle harmoniously. This workshop included clinicians and ontologists, as well as expert curators working on genes for clinical utility. As an outcome of this meeting, the Mondo hierarchy was revised in accordance to the classifications described in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine textbook. See [GitHub tickets](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Harrison+reclassification%22) for more details.

### Date and Time
**April 05, 2021, Monday**  
8am-11am PT / 11am-2pm ET / 4pm-7pm UK / 5pm-8pm Europe

## Mondo Introductory Workshop

### Description: 

The workshop focused on defining ontology patterns and community development processes for ontological disease descriptions. Specifically, there was a need to provision multiple attributes to a disease for computational classification. The attributes need to take into account penetrance, expressivity, genetic variation, histology, biomarkers, temporality, somatic and mosaic characteristics, environmental interactions, etc. There was a need to enable expert curation groups such as in ClinGen, EBI, Orphanet, GARD, MedGen, and OMIM to create disease definitions on the fly, capture the provenance and evidence robustly, and have an identifier for use immediately. This workshop included invited curators, clinicians and ontologists and provided an opportunity to get an overview of Mondo and the source terminologies, as well as networking opportunities.
