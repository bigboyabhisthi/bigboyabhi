MONDO:0100369	iatrogenic or non-iatrogenic	A iatrogenic or non-iatrogenic form of a disease.		
MONDO:0100426	iatrogenic	A characteristic of a diseae which results from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken on a patient.		
MONDO:0100427	non-iatrogenic	A characteristic of a diseae in which it does not result from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken on a patient.		
MONDO:0100428	progressive bulbar palsy of childhood	A progressive bulbar palsy of childhood that occurs during childhood.		
MONDO:0100430	fibrotic liver disease	A liver disease characterized by the presence of excessive fibrous connective tissue in the liver.		
MONDO:0100431	migraine without aura	A migraine disorder characterized by episodes that occur in the absence of preceding focal neurological symptoms.		
MONDO:0100432	FNIP1-associated syndrome	Any immunodeficiency in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the FNIP1 gene. Disruption of Folliculin Interacting Protein 1 alters the essential metabolic regulators AMPK and mTOR, resulting in profound B-cell deficiency, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pre-excitation syndrome.		
MONDO:0100433	ACTB-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia	A syndrome associated with developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, microcephaly, and thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy and enlarged platelets.		
MONDO:0100435	Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1			
MONDO:0100436	cataract 2, multiple types	Any cataract in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the CRYGC gene.		
MONDO:0100439	glycogen storage disease IXa2	Any glycogen storage disease in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the PHKA2 gene, with no PHK in liver, but normal activity in erythrocytes.		
MONDO:0700107	chromosome 19q13.11 deletion syndrome, distal	Chromosome 19q13.11 deletion syndrome in which the distal region was deleted.		
MONDO:8000006	WHIM syndrome 1	A congenital autosomal dominant immune deficiency characterized by abnormal retention of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow (myelokathexis) and occasional hypogammaglobulinemia, associated with an increased risk for bacterial infections and a susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV) induced lesions (cutaneous warts, genital dysplasia and invasive mucosal carcinoma).		
MONDO:8000008	Martsolf syndrome 1	This syndrome is characterized by the association of intellectual deficit, congenital cataract, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.		
MONDO:8000010	antiphospholipid syndrome	A disorder caused by the presence of autoantibodies directed against phospholipids, causing a hypercoaguable state, which may result in blood clots, stroke, heart attack, and in women, significant pregnancy-related complications, including miscarriage and still birth. The syndrome is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, most commonly lupus erythematosus, and infections, including syphilis and Lyme disease.		
MONDO:8000011	visceral neuropathy, familial, 1, autosomal recessive	A form of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction caused by a developmental failure of the enteric neurons to differentiate or migrate properly and manifests as a bowel obstruction.		
MONDO:8000012	neurologic, endocrine, and pancreatic disease, multisystem, infantile-onset 1			
MONDO:8000013	portal hypertension, noncirrhotic, 1			
MONDO:8000014	familial antiphospholipid syndrome	Autosomal dominant form of antiphospholipid syndrome.		
MONDO:8000015	46,XY sex reversal 11	Any 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the DHX37 gene.		
MONDO:8000017	testicular regression syndrome	A developmental anomaly characterized by the absence of one or both testicles with partial or complete absence of testicular tissue. TRS may vary from normal male with unilateral no-palpable testis through phenotypic male with micropenis, to phenotypic female. The phenotype depends on the extent and timing of the intrauterine accident in relation to sexual development.		
MONDO:8000018	benign paroxysmal positional vertigo	Idiopathic recurrent vertigo associated with positional nystagmus. It is associated with a vestibular loss without other neurological or auditory signs. Unlike in labyrinthitis and vestibular neuronitis inflammation in the ear is not observed.		
MONDO:8000019	vertigo, benign recurrent, 1
