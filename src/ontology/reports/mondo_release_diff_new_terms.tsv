MONDO:0100457	achalasia, familial esophageal	An instance of achalsia that is caused by an inherited genomic modification in an individual.		
MONDO:0100458	MECOM-associated syndrome	Any syndrome in which the cause of the disease is a mutation in the MECOM gene. MECOM-associated syndrome has a variable phenotypic pattern, ranging from isolated radioulnar synostosis with no or mild hematological involvement to severe bone marrow failure without obvious skeletal abnormalities. The clinical picture can also include clinodactyly, cardiac and renal malformations, B-cell deficiency, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and presenile hearing loss.		
MONDO:0100461	gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome	A rare genetic disease characterized by multiple intestinal atresia in association with combined immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical features include widespread atresia extending from the stomach to the rectum, homogenous calcifications in the abdominal cavity, hepatic cholestasis, cirrhosis, and chronic liver failure, hypoplastic thymus, and increased susceptibility to mainly bacteria and viruses. The immunological phenotype consists of profound generalized T-cell lymphopenia and milder natural killer cell and B-cell lymphopenia, as well as low serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, with elevated serum IgE. The disease is mostly fatal in infancy or childhood.		
MONDO:0100462	short stature and advanced bone age, with or without early-onset osteoarthritis and/or osteochondritis dissecans	A rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized clinically by abnormal chondro-skeletal development, disproportionate short stature and skeletal deformation mainly affecting the knees, hips, ankles and elbows with onset generally in late childhood or adolescence.
