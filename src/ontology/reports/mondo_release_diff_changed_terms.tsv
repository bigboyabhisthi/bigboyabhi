Vision loss with both varieties is typically rapid (over minutes, hours, or days) and painless. Symptoms such as a general feeling of being unwell (malaise), muscle aches and pains, headaches over the temple, pain when combing hair, pain in the jaw after chewing, and tenderness over the temporal artery (one of the major arteries of the head) may be present with giant cell arteritis. At exam, visual acuity is reduced and the optic disk is swollen. In both subtypes, visual field examination is often reduced in the inferior and central visual fields. The visual loss is usually permanent, with some recovery possibly occurring within the first weeks or months. The arteritic variety is treated with corticosteroids. Treatment of the nonarteritic variety withaspirinor corticosteroids has not been helpful.

MONDO:0006728	definition	OBSOLETE. Inflammation of an intervertebral disk or disk space which may lead to disk erosion. Until recently, discitis has been defined as a nonbacterial inflammation and has been attributed to aseptic processes (e.g., chemical reaction to an injected substance).

Signs and symptoms typically develop when the narrowing of the opening is severe and may include chest pain (angina) or tightness; shortness of breath or fatigue (especially during exertion); feeling faint or fainting; heart palpitations; and heart murmur. Individuals with less severe congenital AVS (present at birth) may not develop symptoms until adulthood. Individuals with severe cases may faint without warning.

MONDO:0044219	definition	OBSOLETE. The Duffy blood group system, which consists of 4 alleles, 5 phenotypes, and 5 antigens, is important in clinical medicine because of transfusion incompatibilities and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Duffy antigens are located on ACKR1 (OMIM:613665), or DARC, an acidic glycoprotein found on erythrocytes and other cells throughout the body. The 2 principal antigens, Fy(a) and Fy(b), are produced by the FYA and FYB codominant alleles (see {613665.0001}). Four phenotypes are defined by the corresponding antibodies, anti-Fy(a) and anti-Fy(b): Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+), Fy(a+b+), and Fy(a-b-). Fy(a-b-), or Duffy null, is the major phenotype in African and American blacks and is characterized by the presence of Fy(b) on nonerythroid cells, but an absence of Fy(b) on erythrocytes. The Fy(a-b-) phenotype is associated with complete resistance to infection by the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax (see OMIM:611162). Individuals with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype have the FYB-erythroid silent (FYB-ES) allele with a mutation in the DARC promoter ({613665.0002}). A fifth phenotype, Fy(bwk), or Fy(x), is characterized by weak Fy(b) expression on erythrocytes due to a reduced amount of protein. Individuals with the Fy(bwk) phenotype have the FYB-weak (FYB-WK) allele, also called the FYX allele, with a missense mutation in DARC ({613665.0003}).

Treatment often includes corticosteroid medications.
