pattern_name: neoendocrine_neoplasm

description: >-

  Note that tumor is typically a synonym for neoplasm, although this
  can be context dependent. For NETs, NCIT uses the nomenclature 'tumor'
  to indicate 'well differentiated, low or intermediate grade tumor'.
  This can also be called carcinoid, see
  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gastrointestinal-carcinoid-tumor/about/what-is-gastrointestinal-carcinoid.html
  We attempt to spell this out in our labels.
