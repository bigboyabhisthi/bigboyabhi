pattern_name: neoplasm

description: >-

  Neoplasms are benign or malignant tissue growths resulting from
  uncontrolled cell proliferation cell types.
  
  This is a design pattern for classes representing neoplasms based on
  their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
  represent a secondary site for malignant neoplasms that have
  metastasized.

  We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
  generalized over primary and secondary sites.

  Note that tumor is typically a synonym for neoplasm, although this
  can be context dependent. For NETs, NCIT uses the nomenclature 'tumor'
  to indicate 'well differentiated, low or intermediate grade tumor'.
  This can also be called carcinoid, see
  https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gastrointestinal-carcinoid-tumor/about/what-is-gastrointestinal-carcinoid.html
  We attempt to spell this out in our labels.
