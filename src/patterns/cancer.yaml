description: >-

  Cancers are malignant neoplasms arising from a variety of different
  cell types.
  
  This is a design pattern for classes representing cancers based
  on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
  represent a secondary site for metastatized cancer.

  We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
  generalized over primary and secondary sites.
