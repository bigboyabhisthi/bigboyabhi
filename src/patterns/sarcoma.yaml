pattern_name: sarcoma

description: >-

  Sarcomas are malignant neoplasms arising from soft tissue or bone.
  
  This is a design pattern for classes representing sarcomas based
  on their location. This may be the site of origin, but it can also
  represent a secondary site for metastatized sarcma.

  We use the generic 'disease has location' relation, which
  generalized over primary and secondary sites.
